/**
 * Guarded worker shutdown sequence: the dying worker drains gracefully under
 * a hard deadline and, on restart, spawns its own successor so no other
 * process races it for the port
 * (plans/2026-06-10-worker-restart-single-source-of-truth.md).
 *
 * This lives in its own module rather than inside worker-service.ts for the
 * same reason as restart-verify.ts: worker-service.ts drags in a very large
 * dependency graph (bun:sqlite, MCP SDK, telemetry, supervisor, express) and
 * ends with an isMainModule bootstrap, which makes it unsafe to import from
 * `bun test`. WorkerService.shutdown() delegates here with its real
 * dependencies — this module IS the production shutdown logic, not a test
 * double.
 *
 * Sequence:
 *   1. Re-entrancy guard — /api/admin/restart, /api/admin/shutdown and the
 *      signal handler can all race into shutdown; only the first wins.
 *   2. Pre-shutdown bookkeeping (watcher/heartbeat/sentinel/telemetry).
 *   3. performGracefulShutdown under a hard deadline — it has no global
 *      deadline of its own and session drain has been observed at 35-40s.
 *   4. reason === 'restart' ONLY: spawn the successor worker as the dying
 *      worker's final act, AFTER the port is confirmed free. 'stop' and
 *      signal shutdowns stay kill-only.
