/**
 * Hook IO Discipline (issue #2292)
 *
 * This module is the ONLY place in the hook execution path that calls
 * console.log / process.stderr.write / process.exit. Every emit point declares
 * an intent and routes through here so stdout (MODEL_CONTEXT), stderr
 * (DIAGNOSTIC / USER_HINT), and exit codes (EXIT_SIGNAL / BLOCKING_FEEDBACK)
 * never get conflated.
 *
 * Intent vocabulary:
 *  - DIAGNOSTIC        operator-visible logs, never reaches the model. stderr.
 *  - MODEL_CONTEXT     content the assistant consumes. stdout JSON only.
 *  - USER_HINT         short advisory shown to the human, via HookResult.systemMessage.
 *  - BLOCKING_FEEDBACK error message the model must see (stderr + exit 2).
 *  - EXIT_SIGNAL       pure status, no payload (exit 0).
 *
 * Lives in src/shared/ (not src/cli/) so that src/shared/worker-utils.ts and
 * src/utils/logger.ts can route their stderr through emitDiagnostic without a
 * shared->cli runtime dependency. Only the HookResult / PlatformAdapter TYPES
 * are imported from src/cli, and `import type` is erased at runtime.
