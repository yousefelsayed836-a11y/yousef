/**
 * Cost-per-observation copy for the installer's provider prompt.
 *
 * Rates are fetched LIVE from OpenRouter and never hardcoded. Model pricing
 * changes constantly and old models tend to get more expensive, so a constant
 * baked into source is wrong the moment it is written. The first version of this
 * file learned that the hard way: within weeks of shipping, its figures had
 * drifted +56% for DeepSeek and +254% for Anthropic Haiku, which made the prompt
 * understate every option that bills the user — i.e. it argued against CMEM Pro
 * using CMEM Pro's own numbers.
 *
 * Derivation:
 *
 *   $/1k observations = blendedRatePerM × TOKENS_PER_OBSERVATION × 1000 / 1e6
 *                     = blendedRatePerM × 56          (at 56k tokens/observation)
 *
 *   blendedRatePerM   = input$/M × 0.987 + output$/M × 0.013
 *
 * The 98.7 / 1.3 split is claude-mem's real traffic shape: observation prompts
 * are enormous and their summaries are small.
